# Notion Page Viewer PHP

This is a simple PHP project designed to fetch content from a specific Notion page (and its direct child pages) and display it as a website. It utilizes the official Notion API and includes features like server-side caching, basic block rendering, URL routing, dynamic meta tags, and robot blocking.

## Features

*   **Notion Content Display**: Renders content from a specified Notion page.
*   **Subpage Routing**: Automatically creates routes for direct child pages of the main Notion page (e.g., `yourdomain.com/subpage-title`). The URL path is generated by normalizing the child page title.
*   **Block Support**: Handles common Notion blocks (headings, paragraphs, lists, todos, images, code, quotes, callouts, dividers, tables, child pages, page mentions).
*   **Rich Text Formatting**: Supports standard Notion formatting (bold, italics, etc.) and links within text and tables.
*   **Server-Side Caching**: Caches Notion API responses to improve performance. Cache duration is configurable.
*   **Dynamic Page Titles & Meta Tags**:
    *   Uses the actual Notion page title for the HTML `<title>` tag and the main `<h1>` header.
    *   Generates dynamic `<meta name="description">` based on the page title.
    *   Generates dynamic Open Graph meta tags (`og:title`, `og:description`, `og:url`, `og:type`) for better social media sharing previews. `og:title` combines main page and subpage titles appropriately.
*   **SEO & Robot Control**:
    *   Includes `<meta name="robots" content="noindex, nofollow">` to instruct standard search engines not to index the site.
    *   Includes a `robots.txt` file to block standard crawlers and specific AI crawlers (`Google-Extended`, `GPTBot`, `ChatGPT-User`, `CCBot`, `ClaudeBot`, etc.) from accessing the site.
*   **JavaScript Enhancements**:
    *   Automatic Table of Contents generation based on H1/H2/H3 headings.
    *   Simple lightbox effect for images.
*   **Content Hiding**: Allows hiding specific sections of Notion content from the rendered webpage by wrapping them in `<hide>` and `</hide>` tags within the Notion page's text blocks. This is processed after the HTML is generated.
    *   **Example Use Case:** If you provide navigation to subpages within a table or main text, you can hide the default list of subpage links (generated from Notion's `child_page` blocks) by placing `<hide>` before the first child page block and `</hide>` after the last one in your Notion document.
*   **Password Protection**: Allows protecting specific sections of Notion content with a password. Wrap the content in `<pass>` and `</pass>` tags within the Notion page's text blocks. Users will be prompted for a password (defined in `private/config.php`) to view the content. This feature uses PHP sessions to remember verification status.
*   **Basic Error Handling**: Includes a simple `error.php` page for 404 and 500 errors.
*   **Simple Setup**: Requires minimal configuration.

## Setup

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone <your-repository-url>
    cd <repository-directory>
    ```
2.  **Configure API Key:** Choose **one** of the following methods:
    *   **Method 1 (Recommended: Environment Variable):** Set the `NOTION_API_KEY` environment variable on your server (e.g., via hosting panel or `SetEnv` in `.htaccess`).
    *   **Method 2 (Alternative: Direct Edit - Less Secure):** Edit `private/config.php` and assign your key to `$notionApiKey` within the `if` block. **Ensure `private/config.php` is in `.gitignore`.**
3.  **Configure Notion Page ID:** Edit `private/config.php` and set `$notionPageId` to your main Notion page ID.
4.  **Configure Content Password (Optional):** Edit `private/config.php` and set a strong `$contentPassword` if you plan to use the `<pass>` tag feature.
5.  **Configure Cache:** Ensure `private/cache/` exists and is writable by the web server. Adjust `$cacheExpiration` in `config.php` if needed.
6.  **Web Server Configuration (Apache):** Ensure `.htaccess` overrides are allowed (`AllowOverride All`) and `mod_rewrite` / `mod_env` are enabled. PHP sessions must also be enabled.
7.  **(Optional) Review `public_html/robots.txt`:** The default file blocks most indexing. Adjust if you have different requirements (not recommended if the content mirrors Notion directly).
8.  **Access the site:** Navigate to the root directory corresponding to `public_html` in your browser.

## Dependencies

*   PHP (tested on 7.x/8.x, requires `curl` extension, session support)
*   Web server (Apache with `mod_rewrite`, `mod_env` recommended)
*   Notion API Key

## Front-end Libraries (via CDN)

*   [Prism.js](https://prismjs.com/): For syntax highlighting.

## Limitations / Known Issues

*   **Performance with Page Mentions**: Fetching titles for many unique page mentions can be slow.
*   **Limited Block Support**: Complex blocks like databases are not supported.
*   **Deeply Nested Blocks**: May not render perfectly.
*   **URL Normalization**: Basic title-to-URL conversion might have edge cases.
*   **No Real-time Updates**: Content updates rely on cache expiration.
*   **Security**: The password protection is basic and relies on PHP sessions. It's suitable for low-sensitivity content. Avoid storing highly confidential information this way.
