# Notion Page Viewer PHP

This is a simple PHP project designed to fetch content from a specific Notion page (and its direct child pages) and display it as a website. It utilizes the official Notion API and includes features like server-side caching, basic block rendering, and URL routing based on child page titles.

## Features

*   **Notion Content Display**: Renders content from a specified Notion page.
*   **Subpage Routing**: Automatically creates routes for direct child pages of the main Notion page (e.g., `yourdomain.com/subpage-title`). The URL path is generated by normalizing the child page title (lowercase, spaces to hyphens, special characters removed).
*   **Block Support**: Handles common Notion blocks including:
    *   Headings (H1, H2, H3)
    *   Paragraphs
    *   Bulleted and Numbered Lists
    *   To-do Lists (rendered as disabled checkboxes)
    *   Images (Internal and External)
    *   Code Blocks (with basic syntax highlighting via Prism.js)
    *   Quotes
    *   Callouts (with emoji or external icons)
    *   Dividers
    *   Tables (including column headers and rendering of rich text/mentions within cells)
    *   Child Page blocks (rendered as links to the subpage on the parent page)
    *   Page Mentions (rendered as internal links, fetching the actual page title)
*   **Rich Text Formatting**: Supports bold, italics, strikethrough, underline, code annotations, and external links within text blocks and table cells.
*   **Server-Side Caching**: Caches Notion API responses (page content, page titles, subpage lists, table rows) to reduce API calls and improve performance. Cache duration is configurable.
*   **Dynamic Page Titles**: Uses the actual Notion page title for the HTML `<title>` tag and the main `<h1>` header (fetched via a separate API call).
*   **JavaScript Enhancements**:
    *   Automatic Table of Contents generation based on H1/H2/H3 headings.
    *   Simple lightbox effect for images.
*   **Basic Error Handling**: Includes a simple `error.php` page for 404 and 500 errors (configured via `.htaccess`).
*   **Simple Setup**: Requires minimal configuration.

## Setup

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone <your-repository-url>
    cd <repository-directory>
    ```
2.  **Configure API Key:** Choose **one** of the following methods:
    *   **Method 1 (Recommended: Environment Variable):**
        *   Set the `NOTION_API_KEY` environment variable on your web server. How you do this depends on your hosting environment:
            *   **Apache with `.htaccess`:** Add the following line to your `public_html/.htaccess` file:
                ```apache
                SetEnv NOTION_API_KEY your_actual_notion_api_key_here
                ```
            *   **Hosting Control Panel:** Look for options like "Environment Variables", "PHP Variables", or similar in your cPanel, Plesk, or other control panel.
            *   **Other Server Configurations (Nginx, Docker, etc.):** Consult your server documentation for setting environment variables for PHP processes.
        *   The `private/config.php` script will automatically detect and use this environment variable via `getenv('NOTION_API_KEY')`.
    *   **Method 2 (Alternative: Direct Edit - Less Secure):**
        *   If you cannot use environment variables, open the `private/config.php` file.
        *   Find the section related to `$notionApiKey`.
        *   Assign your Notion API key directly to the `$notionApiKey` variable within the `if (!$notionApiKey)` block (replacing the placeholder or previous value).
        *   **Crucially:** Ensure `private/config.php` is listed in your `.gitignore` file and **never commit your API key** to version control.

3.  **Configure Notion Page ID:**
    *   Edit `private/config.php` and set the `$notionPageId` variable to the ID of the main Notion page you want to display (the long hexadecimal string in the Notion page URL).
4.  **Configure Cache:**
    *   Ensure the `private/cache/` directory exists.
    *   Make sure the web server process (e.g., `www-data`, `apache`) has **write permissions** for the `private/cache/` directory. This is crucial for caching to work.
    *   You can adjust the default `$cacheExpiration` time (in seconds) in `private/config.php`.
5.  **Web Server Configuration (Apache):**
    *   Ensure your Apache configuration allows `.htaccess` overrides for the `public_html` directory (e.g., `AllowOverride All` in your virtual host or main server config). This is needed for routing and potentially for `SetEnv`.
    *   Ensure `mod_rewrite` and `mod_env` (if using `SetEnv`) are enabled.
6.  **Access the site:** Navigate to the root directory corresponding to `public_html` via your web browser (e.g., `http://yourdomain.com/`).

## Dependencies

*   PHP (tested on 7.x/8.x, requires `curl` extension enabled)
*   Web server (Apache with `mod_rewrite` and `mod_env` enabled recommended)
*   Notion API Key

## Front-end Libraries (via CDN)

*   [Prism.js](https://prismjs.com/): Used for syntax highlighting in code blocks. Included via CDN in `index.php`.

## Limitations / Known Issues

*   **Performance with Page Mentions**: Rendering pages (especially tables) containing many unique page mentions (`@[Page Name]`) can be slow, as each mention might trigger a separate API call to fetch the page title if it's not already cached.
*   **Limited Block Support**: While common blocks are supported, more complex blocks (e.g., databases, synced blocks, advanced table features) are not implemented. Unsupported blocks are currently skipped silently.
*   **Deeply Nested Blocks**: Very deep nesting of blocks might not render correctly, although basic list nesting should work.
*   **URL Normalization**: The conversion from Notion page titles to URL paths (`normalizeTitleForPath` function) is basic. Titles with unusual characters or identical normalized paths might cause unexpected behavior.
*   **No Real-time Updates**: Content is updated based on the cache expiration time. There's no mechanism for real-time updates via webhooks.
